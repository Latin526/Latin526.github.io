Github for me was a platform that I did not understand how to use, in someways I still don't but I do understand it a whole lot more than I did years go; if that makes any sense. I joined Github in 2016 but could not get the concipt of it, tutorials or youtube videos were not helping me. So, I join Flatiron School and in a few days of classes I have understood more about than from other videos.

Upon joining Flatiron School, I have understood more in a month than me just doing it on my own from follwing tutorials. The more I read, research and code the more I grow as a developer. In a few months I have learned Ruby and ruby was a language that I did not want to get into. However, Ruby is not all that scary like some people would like to think neither is Github. When I join github back in 2016 I did not know where to start, tutorial were not helping and articles were to long to read, so I gave up on it; even to continue learning. 

Github can be very confusing and hard to learn, unless there is someone out there that can explain it. Even though, I have learned something in it, it stills confuses me and even harder is to try to memorize every function. It is said that the more you use it the more you will memorize it and it will be like riding a bike. In this case I hope that sentce becomes true, because I am only getting older.

The platform github  is for those serious developers that love to have great adventures. From now on, I will continue to practice in it and to continue some articles and tutorials. After all, practice makes perfect!!!
