My journey so far has been a hard one. I have relocated my home in search of new experiences and new people. It has been 3 months that I have started this journey and it feels like it is slowly moving for me. Maybe I am wrong to want to have things speed up or I am not seeing the speed that it is actually part taking. 

However, in three months I have learned so many great things; such as, Ruby, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, and other languages. When I first started I did not want to take a Fullstack Developing class, but in doing so I have learned to code in languages that did not think I would have been able to learn. Even though, I would like to find a job as a front end developer knowing some of the backend is not all that bad either. 

There is still so much to learn and my education doesn't end after bootcamp is over it is only the beginning of things. I have done some job searches on my own and it intimidates me because of the employers requirements, some are asking for languages that I have yet on heard of and it makes me anxious just thinking about it. I have thought of doing freelancing but I must admit that I don't even know where to start, also my goal is to find something remotely; for the reason being is that since I have moved there is only one car to depend on and I rather have my fiance use it so that he may go to work.

There are tons of tutorial in developing and I do follow some especially on YouTube, even with their advise and tips on developing or job search makes me wonder if I have done the right thing on learning to code. I have a bachelor in Computer Science and no background certifications inwhich makes me nervous when trying to apply. Some may ask; "Does she really loves to code?" to this I must say yes, I do love it. 

As my journey continues in this career path that I have chosen for myself in hope of some stability in my financial situation and so that my children can reconize that they too can chose something that will me their life meaningful and they are happy in doing whatever it is they want to do.
