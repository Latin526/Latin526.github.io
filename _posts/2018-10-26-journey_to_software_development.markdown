The journey for **Software Development** started when I was in college. As a computer science graduate coding was that got my interest the most; however, I did get to work with some languages; such as,**** MySQL, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript***, and others; moreover, since my studies were more about network, information system security, and routers. The coding was very limited but it still got my interest and trying to find a job after graduation has been hard just because I do not have any certifications to back my bachelor degree in computer science. I have done some side work on trying to learn on my own how to code especially in Web Development by using some online tutorials. Also, learning how to use some framework such as **Bootstrap** and now **Materialize** it is still a bit confusing for me but I know I will get the concept of it. 

This is a journey that I am very excited to take on and can not wait to see what the outcome of it all will be. Learning is something that we all do everyday whether it be in school or just in life in general, so signing up for a coding bootcamp became a easy decision for me just because it is all about how to learn to code. 

As I said before, this is all very exciting and I am more than happy to have made the right decision.
